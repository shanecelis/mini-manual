== The Objective

Create a game. Thatâ€™s it. Use any resources you can find.

=== What is a game?

A game has an objective--a way to win--and a set of rules for what can and
cannot be done.

=== What is a toy?

A toy is something that is fun to play with.

=== _toy + objective = game_

A good game is fun to play and win.

== Hello, Editor!

Every intrepid game developer will confront code if they are to realize their
dream. As is tradition, we will face it and say hello. But first you must choose
your means of expression, you must choose a text editor.

[caption="Interlude 1."]
==========================

image:old-man.png[Old man, 32, 32] An old man with a long beard presents his
wares, text editors of all manner. You tell him you are happy using your word
processor. He laughs. "`Those are no text editors, my friend. Come let me show
you.`"

* TextEdit or Notepad, these are rarefied editors. No cruft. No frills either,
  like a old house. "`One of them is probably in your house already.`"

* https://zed.dev[Zed] or https://code.visualstudio.com[VS Code], these are
  sleek, modern editors; many niceties, like a new house.

* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ] or
  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com[Visual Studio], these behemoths are more
  than text editors. They slice, dice, compile and debug, like a new city.


* https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs] and https://www.vim.org[vim], these
  are for the select few. Powerful and archaic. Cryptic and idiosyncratic, like
  old ruins.

You look upon the choices and do not know what to choose. You ask, "`Which is
best?`"

The old man laughs. "`The one which you know already is best of course.`"
==========================

Choose a text editor before continuing to the next page.

## Hello, World!

Congratulations. A text editor has been added to your inventory.

Using your text edtior, write this code into the file `hello.lua`.

[source]
text:print("Hello, World!")

Then exercise it using this command in the terminal:

[source, sh]
$ nano-9 hello.lua

You should see a blank screen with the following text:

## The Grid

[quote,Kevin Flynn,'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-J4duzP8Ng[Tron Legacy]']
"`The Grid. A digital frontier. I tried to picture clusters of information as
they moved through the computer. What did they look like? Ships, motorcycles?
Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never
see. And then, one day I got in...`"

image::red-pixel.svg[float=right,title="A red pixel at position _(x,y) = (32, 64)_",pdfwidth=40%]

In order to plot the merest of pixels, you must recon with _The Grid_. The image
grid represents 128 pixels by 128 pixels. The _x_-axis specifies the horizontal
position. The _y_-axis specifies the vertical position. To plot a pixel at _x =
32_ and _y = 64_, write: `background:set_pixel(32, 64)`

## Of Faeries, Sprites, and Pixies

[quote, Gaiman & Chesterton]
"`Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist,
but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.`"

What you can do with pixels, you can do with sprites.

### What are sprites?

Sprites are often little people, both in folklore and video games. In video
games they are found in images. Pick an
https://itch.io/search?type=games&q=1-bit+sprites+free[image]. Load that
image.

[source]
pixie = image:load("pixie.png")

Now capture a sprite!

[source]
pixie:spr()

You should see your sprite like this but only for a moment:

image::pixie-screenshot.png[align=center]

They are skittish. You'll need to capture them to keep them from vanishing. Here is how:

[source]
jar = pixie:spr()







## The Loop


## Accepting Outside Input

With what you have learned, you are now able to create screen savers, a pristine
graphical expression free from the corrosive influence of the outside world. We,
however, yearn to do more and must solicit the user for input--but how?

image::controller.svg[title="An ideal controller",float="right",align="center"]

We imagine a controller with 6 buttons: a directional pad with four directions
left, right, up, down and two buttons: primary and secondary. To access these
buttons we use the functions `btn()` and `btnp()`.

[source]
--
left_held_down = btn(0)
left_just_pressed = btnp(0)
--

== What is it?

NOTE: Please read this instruction booklet to ensure proper handling of your new
game, and then save the booklet for future reference.

Nano-9 is a game development platform, inspired by the Pico-8 platform. Pico-8
is a limited but _comprehensive_ development environment covering the full gamut
of game development. It offers a built-in text editor, sprite editor, map
editor, sound effects editor, and music sequencer. But it is limited to a fixed
16-color palette, 128x128 display, controllers with one directional-pad and two
buttons.
