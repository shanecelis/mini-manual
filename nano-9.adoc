== What is it?

Nano-9 is a game development platform, inspired by the Pico-8 platform. Pico-8
is a limited but comprehensive development environment covering the full gamut
of game development. It offers a built-in text editor, sprite editor, map
editor, sound effects editor, and music sequencer. But it is limited to a fixed
16-color palette, 128x128 display, controllers with one directional-pad and two
buttons.
