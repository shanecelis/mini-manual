== Objective

Create a game. That’s it. You can use any resources you can find.

=== What is a game?

A game has an objective, a win condition, and a set of rules for what can and cannot be done.

=== What is a toy?

A toy is something that is fun to play with.

A good game is fun to play and win.

== Hello, Editor!


Every intrepid game developer must say hello to code if they are to realize
their dream. As is tradition, we will say hello. But first you must choose a
text editor.

==========================

An old man with a long beard presents his wares, text editors of all manner and
glyphs. You tell him you are happy using your word processor. He laughs. “Those
are no text editors, my friend. Come let me show you."

* TextEdit or Notepad, these are rarefied editors. No cruft. No frills either and builtin.

* JetBrains or Visual Studio, these behemoths are more than text editors. They slice, dice, compile and debug.

* Emacs and vim, these are for the select few. Powerful and archaic. Cryptic and idiosyncratic.

You look upon the choices and do not know what to choose. You ask, “Which is best?”

The old man laughs. “The one which you know already is best.”

==========================

Choose a text editor before contributing to the next page.

## Hello, World!

Congratulations. A text editor has been added to your inventory.

Using your text edtior, write this code into the file `main.lua`.

```lua
text.default: print ("Hello, World!")
```

== What is it?

NOTE: Please read this instruction booklet to ensure proper handling of your new game, and then save the booklet for future reference.

Nano-9 is a game development platform, inspired by the Pico-8 platform. Pico-8
is a limited but comprehensive development environment covering the full gamut
of game development. It offers a built-in text editor, sprite editor, map
editor, sound effects editor, and music sequencer. But it is limited to a fixed
16-color palette, 128x128 display, controllers with one directional-pad and two
buttons.
